      <h2>OpenSesame</h2>
      <img src="img/opensesame.jpg" alt="OpenSesame Intern Program">
      <p>This is me with the 2017 Summer Intern program at OpenSesame, located in Portland, Oregon. <br>
        After the summer program ended, I came back as a part-time intern (from home) working on internal web development projects in Node.js, PHP, and Angular, which I'm still doing now.</p>

      <h2>My Dev Environment</h2>
      <img src="img/vscode.png" alt="Visual Studio Code in Linux">
      <p>This is the current assignment being created in Visual Studio Code, my IDE of choice. <br>
      My operating system is KDE Neon, a Linux distro based on Ubuntu, because I enjoy having freedom, customizability, and the Bash shell right at my fingertips.</p>

      <h2>Music Taste</h2>
      <img class="smaller-img" src="img/music.jpeg" alt="5x5 collage of albums">
      <p>These are some of my favorite albums as of late (generated from my Last.fm data).<br>
      I enjoy hip hop, metal, experimental, electronic, and many other styles of music.<br>
      While programming, I'll sometimes put on some "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ">chill lofi hip hop beats</a>".</p>

      <h2>Electronic Music</h2>
      <img src="img/serum.jpg" alt="Xfer Serum synthesizer">
      <p>I've recently started experimenting with synthesizers and making electronic music.<br>
      My favorite synth is Xfer Serum (pictured), which I've been using to make basses, leads, drums, and all sorts of effects.</p>

      <h2>Christian Lovers</h2>
      <img src="img/chrlo.jpg" alt="Christian Lovers band">
      <p>This is an improv punk band I joined a month ago on drums (there are no pictures yet of me with them). <br>
        We make noisy, experimental, chaotic music.
