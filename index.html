        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a full-stack web developer, currently interning at a Portland company called OpenSesame, and will soon be finishing a Computer Science degree at Cal State Fullerton. </p>
        <p>In my free time, when I'm not learning about web technologies, I play drums and piano, and compose/mix music electronically. I've been playing piano since before kindergarten, and have wide-ranging musical tastes.</p>

    <h2>Why am I in this course?</h2>
        <p>I have a passion for web development, and up until this point I have been almost entirely self-taught. Taking this course will help me refresh the basics, fill in any blanks I haven't addressed yet, and inspire new ideas in my career and personal goals.</p>
        <p>I've been learning web development since early high school, and yet I still feel like I've just scratched the surface of what there is to learn. The web is a constantly evolving field, and I'm excited to continue exploring it.</p>
